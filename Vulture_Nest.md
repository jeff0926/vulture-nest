### 🦅 "Bible Marker" - The Precision Study Highlighter
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.0/10
- **The Gap:** Users of online Bible platforms (like YouVersion, BibleGateway) are frustrated with the inability to highlight individual words or phrases, only entire verses. This limitation hinders deep, focused study and forces users into inefficient workarounds with external note-taking apps.
- **Melting Tags:** [#ChromeExtension, #Productivity, #BibleStudy, #Niche]
- **Build Brick Size:** [Size: S/M]

### 🦅 Browser-Based AI Code Agent
- **Status:** Vulture Nest
- **Vulture Grade:** 9/10 (High Pain, High Velocity, High Profit)
- **The Gap:** The trend in AI development is shifting towards "agentic" assistants that understand entire codebases. This functionality is currently confined to desktop IDEs (VS Code, Cursor), leaving a major gap for users of web-based environments like GitHub, Replit, or educational coding platforms.
- **Melting Tags:** [#AI, #DeveloperTool, #ChromeExtension]
- **Build Brick:** A Chrome Extension that can read the content of multiple files from a user's opened tabs (with permission) to build a temporary "codebase context." This context is then injected into the prompt for a standard LLM call, likely via a Python backend.
- **Evidence:** Web searches show a clear and dominant trend towards "AI Agents" and "codebase context" in the developer tool space. The Chrome Web Store is almost completely devoid of any extensions that fulfill this need.
---
### 🦅 OneTab Power-Up: Sync & Group
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.8/10 (Refined Score)
- **The Gap:** The popular OneTab Chrome extension is beloved for its simplicity but is "successfully neglecting" its power users due to a lack of cross-device syncing and tab grouping features.
- **Melting Tags:** [#ChromeExtension, #Productivity, #OneTab, #Sync]
- **Build Brick:** A lightweight "parasitic" Chrome Extension that reads the OneTab page's DOM, injects grouping UI, and uses `chrome.storage.sync` for cross-device syncing.
- **Evidence:** Multiple software review and alternative sites explicitly call out the lack of sync and organization as the primary drivers for users to seek alternatives.
---
### 🦅 No-Code Portal Customizer for AI Knowledge Bases
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.65/10 (Critical Melt)
- **The Gap:** Users of AI knowledge base platforms (like Document360) face significant pain with the complex, code-heavy customization of their customer-facing portals.
- **Melting Tags:** [#KnowledgeBase, #AI, #NoCode, #Customization, #MicroSaaS]
- **Build Brick:** A micro-SaaS with a no-code, drag-and-drop editor for designing custom knowledge base portals that integrate with existing platforms via API.
- **Evidence:** User reviews for platforms like Document360 highlight frustrations with costly features and the need for CSS workarounds for customization.

### 🦅 Automated Status Reporter for Linear
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.75/10 (Critical Melt)
- **The Gap:** The developer-focused project management tool Linear lacks the advanced, customizable reporting features needed by non-technical stakeholders (PMs, executives).
- **Melting Tags:** [#DeveloperTool, #Reporting, #Automation, #LinearApp, #MicroSaaS]
- **Build Brick:** A micro-SaaS that connects to the Linear API to generate automated, shareable reports (progress summaries, velocity charts, health dashboards) via a no-code report builder.
- **Evidence:** User reviews and comparisons repeatedly highlight Linear's "basic reporting" and lack of "in-depth analytics" as a key weakness compared to enterprise tools like Jira.

### 🦅 AI-Powered Unified Documentation Creator
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.8/10 (Critical Melt)
- **The Gap:** Content creators and solopreneurs struggle with the fragmented and time-consuming process of turning disparate content inputs (text, video, browser recordings) into coherent, multi-format documentation. Current tools force manual effort or limit input types, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistent documentation.
- **Melting Tags:** [#ContentCreation, #Automation, #AI, #MicroSaaS, #Documentation]
- **Build Brick:** A Size M Python-based Micro-SaaS web application that accepts diverse inputs (e.g., pasted text, uploaded video/audio, browser recording data). It uses AI to intelligently process, unify, and format this content into structured documentation (e.g., step-by-step guides with embedded video, searchable FAQs, blog posts) for various platforms. Its core value is the automation of content repurposing and documentation generation from a single, unified source.
- **Evidence:** The "AI Content Repurposing Tool" was identified as a trending micro-SaaS idea. User pain with existing documentation tools (Scribe, Loom) highlights the fragmentation and manual effort involved in creating comprehensive guides. The demand for AI to automate content transformation is high, making a unified platform a high-value solution for creators and solopreneurs.

### 🦅 "Highlight Hub" Chrome Extension: Collaborative & Resilient Web Annotation
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 8.65/10 (Critical Melt)
- **The Gap:** Users of web highlighting extensions like Web Highlights face significant pain with disappearing highlights (due to website changes, dynamic content), poor website compatibility (complex layouts, dynamic URLs), performance issues, and limited collaboration features. The core frustration is the fragility and isolation of their saved annotations.
- **Melting Tags:** [#ChromeExtension, #Productivity, #Collaboration, #WebAnnotation, #DeveloperTool, #SaaS]
- **Build Brick:** A Size S Chrome Extension with a Python backend (micro-SaaS). The extension captures highlights and notes with enhanced resilience (e.g., storing content and DOM context, not just CSS selectors) to prevent disappearance. The Python backend stores and synchronizes these annotations across devices, and enables real-time collaboration (shared highlights, comments) with a simple UI. Advanced features could include AI-powered context preservation and smart re-application of highlights.
- **Evidence:** User reviews for Web Highlights explicitly detail issues with "disappearing highlights," "website compatibility," and "performance impact." The existence of numerous alternatives like Glasp, Hypothes.is (which offer collaboration), and SaveDay (AI bookmarking) confirms the high demand for robust web annotation. The gap is for a solution that combines Web Highlights' simplicity with advanced resilience and seamless collaboration, targeting the fragility of personal knowledge management on the web.

### 🦅 "AI Content Co-pilot" - Intelligent Content Repurposing
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 9.5/10
- **The Gap:** Creators and solopreneurs struggle with the time-consuming task of manually adapting their long-form content (podcasts, videos) into contextually-aware formats for different social media platforms. Existing tools only automate distribution, not the crucial content transformation.
- **Build Brick Size:** [Size: M]

### 🦅 Etsy Policy Guardian
- **Status:** Build Queue
- **Vulture Grade:** 13.31/10 (ULTRA-GREENLIGHT)
- **The Gap:** Etsy sellers face high anxiety and financial risk due to arbitrary account suspensions and opaque policy enforcement. They lack a proactive tool to ensure listing compliance and generate appeal templates.
- **Melting Tags:** [#Etsy, #Compliance, #MicroSaaS, #AI, #PolicyGuardian]
- **Build Brick Size:** [Size: M]
- **Dossier & Build Plan:** [View Full Dossier](./builds/Etsy Policy Guardian/README.md)
